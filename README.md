# About this project:
- I'm aware that using things like `parseFloat` and performing operations based on the string showed in the display would be easier, and most people probably build the project this way, but I decided to take the more difficult route for learning purposes.
- So, all operations are performed based on numbers, only then converted to a string which is showed on display. Even the input process algorithm uses numbers only.
- For this reason the code doesn't look so clean, since it was trickier to figure out the logic.

## Update: December 19, 2022
- Bug fixes:
    - square root not working after a basic operation
    - decimal formating

## Update: December 18, 2022
- Almost full functional (percentage left)
- Added: memory function, sqrt, clear
- Bug fixes:
    - decimal not working properly
    - expression behavior

## Deployed: December 17, 2022
- Basic HTML/CSS structure (provisory)
